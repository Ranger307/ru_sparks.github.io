            <div><p class="paragraph-item1" style="font-size: 18px;">I am from Powell Wyoming, and lived there my whole life.<br> My family live out in
        the country and we own about six<br> acres of land. My family own 3 dogs and as a family we breed two our
        two doodles.<br> I am a mechanic at my uncles automotive and marine shop,<br> and I have worked there for 6 years 
        I love hanging out with my friends when I can,<br> and playing games when I have the chance. I am always willing
        to help people<br> in every way I can. If that means helping you<br> with any mechanical issues, or helping you do
        yard work or farming.<br> I am currently at college studying Software Development. I hope I can graduate in
        3 years, but to do that I will need to a lot of classes a semester than is required.

                <!-- Snowboarding -->
                <li style="font-size: 18px;"> <b>Snowboarding:</b> I love to snowboard, when I was in fitfth grade I was able to go for free<br>
                    that year. One of my uncles took me with him when he went snowboarding and taught me how<br>
                    to snowbaord. After that one time I was unable to go again, until 3 years ago. 3 years ago<br>
                    I was invited to go with another one of my uncles and our friends. After that trip I really<br>
                    wanted to get better at snowbaording. So last year when I was able to get a free season pass<br>
                    to one of our ski resorts; I went about 10-15 times that year, and started to pick up how to<br>
                    take jumps, go down the mountain with more control, and go down harder trails while almost<br>
                    staying caught up with my friends. I love to snowboard and I am always excited for the next trip!<br>
                </li>
                    <!-- Hunting -->
                <li style="font-size: 18px;"> <b>Hunting:</b> I Have been hunting since the day I could, wether that meant I just went with my grandpa<br>
                     and which ever aunt or uncle had a tag, or that meant I went hunting for my own tags. I have always<br>
                     Loved Hunting, it is my one of my favorite things to do in the winter. I love it most because it is,<br>
                     somthing that allows me to spend time with my friends and family.<br>
                </li>
                    <!-- Driving -->
                <li style="font-size: 18px;"> <b>Driving:</b> Driving is one of the best priviliges I was allowed to get. I have always loved driving and<br>
                     I became my dads designated driver while I had my permit and I went with him. I own a 2005 Chevy<br>
                     Colorado and I love driving that thing. I put a new engine, transmission, and front end on my truck<br>
                     over the two years I have owned it. I love jamming to music while driving, especially country music, <br>
                     I also like music with a good bass or drumming in the back ground, cause if there is any good bass <br>
                     or drumming in the background then I am putting the volume to the max and rolling down my windows to<br>
                     jam to the music!
                </li>
                    <!-- Fixing Stuff -->
                <li style="font-size: 18px;"> <b>Fixing stuff:</b> Ever since I started working at my uncles automotive and marine shop I have enjoyed fixing<br>
                    things. When I say fix things I mean anything I know I can fix. So if that means fixing a friends or families<br>
                    vehicle then that means I am going to enjoy fixing it. If that means fixing something electrical, I will<br>
                    probably enjoy that. If that means I am helping you do yard work and fixing stuff around the house then I<br>
                    will mostly like that. I love being able to help friends and family. I would helpe my uncle fix his vehicle<br> 
                    all the time and I always enjoyed that. I love it when I am able to help everyone with my skills<br>
                    and knowledge of things.

                    <!-- Gaming -->
                <li style="font-size: 18px;"> <b>Gaming:</b> My whole life I have had some access to at least one way of being able to play games. I grew up<br>
                    on the gamecube, playstation 2, N64, and Xbox 360. I have played Zelda, Rush, Battle Tanks, Army Men, Super Mario,<br>
                    Super Smash Bros, Halo, Call of Duty, Raibow Six Siege, and Apex Legends. I love gaming especially when I can play with my friends.</li>
